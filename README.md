# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

npm run start

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on web
npm run web
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Development Notes

### Expo Go Limitations
The app uses `expo-notifications` for reminder functionality, which has limited support in Expo Go since SDK 53. You'll see this warning when testing in Expo Go:

```
expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality 
provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53. 
Use a development build instead of Expo Go.
```

**This is expected behavior and won't affect app functionality.** The app gracefully handles this limitation:

- ‚úÖ **In Expo Go**: Notification features are disabled but all other functionality works normally
- ‚úÖ **In Production**: Full notification support when built as a standalone app
- ‚úÖ **Development Build**: Full notification support for testing

### For Full Notification Testing
If you need to test the complete reminder/notification system:

1. **Create a development build**:
   ```bash
   npx expo install --fix
   npx expo prebuild
   npx expo run:android  # or expo run:ios
   ```

2. **Or build for production**:
   ```bash
   npx expo build
   ```

### Pro Features in Expo Go
Some Pro features have limited functionality in Expo Go but work fully in production:
- **Notifications**: Limited in Expo Go, full support in production builds
- **SMS Integration**: Works in production builds
- **Contacts Integration**: Works in production builds
- **Export Features**: Fully functional in Expo Go

## üí° Usage Guide

### Adding a Transaction
1. Tap the floating `+` button on the Dashboard
2. Select "I lent money" or "I borrowed money"
3. Fill in the amount and person's name (required)
4. Add optional note and due date
5. The date defaults to today but can be changed
6. Tap "Save Transaction"

### Managing Transactions
- **Settle**: Tap the "Settle" button on any active transaction
- **View History**: Check the History tab for settled transactions
- **Export Data**: Use the export button in History for PDF/CSV reports

### Security Setup
1. Go to Settings
2. Enable PIN Protection and set a secure PIN
3. Optionally enable Biometric Authentication
4. The app will lock when backgrounded and require authentication

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage Only**: No data leaves your device
- **Optional Encryption**: PIN-protected access
- **Biometric Support**: Fingerprint/Face ID integration
- **Background Protection**: App locks when minimized

## üìä Export System

The export functionality is designed to be modular and can be easily detached to create a premium version:

### Features
- Generate HTML reports with transaction summaries
- Export CSV data for Excel compatibility
- Share reports via email, messaging, or cloud storage
- Customizable report templates

### Modular Design
The `ExportManager` class in `/utils/export/` can be:
- Removed entirely for a free version
- Enhanced with premium features
- Packaged as a separate module for licensing

## üé® UI/UX Features

- **Material Design**: Clean, modern interface
- **Color-coded Transactions**: Green for lending, red for borrowing
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with clear icons
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on phones and tablets
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatic theme switching
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly

## üîß Development Notes

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues in Development:**

1. **Notification Warnings in Expo Go**
   - Expected behavior - notifications have limited support in Expo Go since SDK 53
   - App functions normally, notifications just won't trigger
   - Use development build for full notification testing

2. **Export Errors**
   - If you see `writeAsStringAsync deprecated` warnings, this is handled by the legacy API import
   - Export functionality works normally in both Expo Go and production

3. **Metro Cache Issues**
   - Clear cache with `npx expo start --clear` if experiencing build issues
   - Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` if problems persist

4. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for TypeScript issues
   - All type definitions are in `/types/index.ts`

**Performance Tips:**
- The app is optimized for development in Expo Go
- Production builds will have better performance and full feature support
- Use development builds for testing Pro features that require native modules
